Curated list of awesome OpenMage extensions, resources and other highlights.

## Most important resources for new projects
- [OpenMage official GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts)
- [Download OpenMage official releases](https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases)
- Use OpenMage v20 to have the more cutting edge version of OpenMage

## Install OpenMage

1. Configure your web server (virtual host or subfolder of a domain)
2. Create the folder where you want to install OpenMage, enter it and execute  
`composer require "openmage/magento-lts":"^20"`  
it will automatically download the latest v20 release then ask for the OpenMage root directory, my suggestion is to use `.` (the current directory)
3. open your web browser and navigate to the URL you configured in point 1, the web installer will take care of the rest
